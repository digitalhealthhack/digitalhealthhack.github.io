##Contact Information
If have a query or concern, please contact a member of the DHOx organising group. You may also contact Business School staff and ask to be put in touch with the event organiser — Richie Harrington, or Launchpad curator — James Murray.

##IP
All submissions remain the intellectual property of the individuals or groups that developed them.  It is team-members responsibility to check and declare any pre-existing clauses in their employment contract that may have implications with any non-opensource projects developed.  If you have any concerns about IP, please contact Richie during the weekend.

##Judging
All projects must be started and finished within the weekend, though you are free to use any existing APIs or libraries, or build new functionality or improve on an existing project (i.e. you can't submit a project you've been working on for the last two months). Judging of submissions will be based on three criteria:

- Impact
  - would this application have a real impact?
  - does it solve a stated goal?
  - does it address one of the stated challenges?
- Innovation
  - does it address the problem in a creative way?
  - is the solution novel?
- Technical
  - does the solution address and deal with a difficult technical problem?
  - is there a working demo of the application, completed within on time?
- Bonus points will also be given to teams that demonstrate interdisciplinary collaboration.

##Food and Drink
Food and drink will be provided free of charge throughout the weekend, served at regular intervals. There is also a Common Room cafe at the back of the Business School. There are water coolers around the building, and other food outlets nearby in the train station and across the road from the Business School.

##Security
