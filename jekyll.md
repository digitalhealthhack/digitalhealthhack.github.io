The Digital Health Oxford Hack Weeeknds bring together people interested in the field of digital health from Oxford (and beyond). They are open to developers, designers, engineers, clinicians, patients, entrepreneurs, and others interested in the field.

You don't have to be an expert in digital health to participate, it's open to everyone.  We encourage people to form multidisciplinary teams, and the main aim of these hacks is to get members of the DHOx community identifying and working together on specific problems, and to come up with working prototype(s) and/or improvements to existing solutions / technologies / platforms.  These prototypes could be digital / apps / services, paper-based, or somewhere in between (e.g. clickable wireframes).
