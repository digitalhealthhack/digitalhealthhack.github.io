The Digital Health Oxford Hack Weeeknds bring together people interested in the field of digital health from Oxford (and beyond). They are open to developers, designers, engineers, clinicians, patients, entrepreneurs, and others interested in the field.

You don't have to be an expert in digital health to participate, it's open to everyone.  We encourage people to form multidisciplinary teams, and the main aim of these hacks is to get members of the DHOx community identifying and working together on specific problems, and to come up with working prototype(s) and/or improvements to existing solutions / technologies / platforms.  These prototypes could be digital / apps / services, paper-based, or somewhere in between (e.g. clickable wireframes).

In the past events, we've had a team who created a prototype that led to them winning a place on the Bethnal Green Ventures accelerator program (Project Tide), another went on to present at the Digital Catapult in London (WHOAMI), and we also helped to kickstart a project that is now crowdfunding for Â£100k (the LIFE Project).  You can read more about previous hack weekends and their projects <a href="/blog">here</a>.
