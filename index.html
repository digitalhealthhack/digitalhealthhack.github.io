  <h1 class="page-heading">Digital Health Hack - Spring 2016</h1>

  <p>
    The Digital Health Oxford Hack Weeeknds bring together people interested in the field of digital health from Oxford (and beyond). They are open to developers, designers, engineers, clinicians, patients, entrepreneurs, and others interested in the field.  The spring 2016 Digital Health Hack will be held on the <b>7th and 8th May in <a href="http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/community/school-university/collaborations/oxford-launchpad">The Launchpad at the Said Business School</a></b>.

  <p>
    The main aim of this hackathon is to get members of the DHOx community identifying and working together on specific problems, and to come up with working prototype(s) and/or improvements to existing solutions / technologies / platforms.  Whilst participants are able to work on any project they'd like, the upcoming weekend has a focus on <b>Open Data, Open Source and Open Standards</b>.  This topic is a very broad one, for example, if you'd like to build an app to communicate between doctors and patients with chronic conditions, then you could base the communication on Open Standards, if you'd like to process <a href="https://data.gov.uk/data/search?theme-primary=Health&core_dataset=true&api=true&unpublished=false">NHS Choices data</a>, that falls under Open Data, and there is a growing amount of Open Source software (and hardware) tools being developed for and used in health and healthcare, for example, <a href="http://openmrs.org/">OpenMRS</a>, the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/09/09/nhs_spin2_rips_out_oracle/">NHS Spine database</a> is build using the Open Source Riak database, and of course Apple's ResearchKit is an Open Source tool.

  <h1 class="page-heading">Who is the weekend aimed at</h1>

  <p>     
    Enterprising Oxford wrote a great blog post called <b><a href="http://www.eship.ox.ac.uk/hacking-not-just-computer-geeks">Hacking is not just for Computer Geeks</a></b> a few months ago.  The Digital Health Hacks adhere to a principle of being inclusive and supportive, and are open to everyone regardless of skillset.  As stated in the <i>"Hackathons bring people from various backgrounds together to work on and try and solve a problem.  It is really a big excuse to get together and work collaboratively on a problem."</i> There is also a lovely quote from Rohan Gunatillake, from Culture Hack Scotland:

    <blockquote>
    ‘Hack events are less of a factory and more of a gym, a playground and a nightclub. It’s a gym since it builds our prototyping and risk-taking muscles, a playground since it gives us a low-risk environment to try some things that are radically new and it’s a nightclub since it allows us to dance with a lot of different people we may not have otherwise met. And who knows, we may just meet the love of our lives.’        
    </blockquote>

<h1 class="page-heading">Participant Pen Pictures</h1>
<p>
We're looking for people who have ideas and skills and an interest in digital health, and if you're reading this, that probably describes you. All you need to do now is to come along to the Launchpad on the morning of Sat 7th May, armed with energy and enthusiasm (and a laptop if you'd like). People can pitch their ideas at the start of the day, then we'll arrange ourselves into teams to start working for the weekend.  Teams of around 4-5 people are generally the best size, and a mix of skills can be very valuable e.g. a team comprised of software skills, domain experience (e.g. clinician, researcher) and project management.  To help with team building, we'll be asking people to write down a couple of sentences about themselves on a postit note, for example:

<blockquote>Chris, DPhil student working in a biomedical research group. Have an idea for modelling WHO data on trans-national co-morbidities.  Expertise in R and Python.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Stephanie, trainee GP. Have an idea for building a chronic disease monitoring app for patients using Apple's ResearchKit</blockquote>
<blockquote>Owen, software engineer, previously worked on a number of healthcare projects and have expertise in APIs and data modelling. Favourite programming languages are Python, Ruby and all flavours of Javascript.</blockquote>

We have a <b><a class-"page-link" href="/using_trello">Trello board</a></b> to start off these participant pen pictures and ideas online before the weekend, and will also move these to paper versions for Saturday morning. The board also has lots of different ideas and resources - please send us an email if you'd like to sign up to this.
