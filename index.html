  <h1 class="page-heading">Digital Health Hack</h1>

  <p>
    The Digital Health Hacks are weekends to bring together people interested in the field of digital health from Oxford (and beyond). It's open to developers, designers, engineers, clinicians, patients, entrepreneurs, and others interested in the field.

  <p>
    The main aim of this hackathon is to get members of the DHOx community identifying and working together on specific problems, and to come up with working prototype(s) and/or improvements to existing solutions / technologies / platforms.
