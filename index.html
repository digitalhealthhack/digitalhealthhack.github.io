  <h1 class="page-heading">Digital Health Hack - Spring 2016</h1>

  <p>
    The Digital Health Oxford Hack Weeeknds bring together people interested in the field of digital health from Oxford (and beyond). They are open to developers, designers, engineers, clinicians, patients, entrepreneurs, and others interested in the field.  The spring 2016 Digital Health Hack will be held on the <b>7th and 8th May in <a href="http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/community/school-university/collaborations/oxford-launchpad">The Launchpad at the Said Business School</a></b>.

  <p>
    The main aim of this hackathon is to get members of the DHOx community identifying and working together on specific problems, and to come up with working prototype(s) and/or improvements to existing solutions / technologies / platforms.  Whilst participants are able to work on any project they'd like, the upcoming weekend has a focus on <a href="hackathon/2016/05/05/DHOxHack%234-Spring-2016/">'Open Data, Open Source and Open Standards'</a>.

 <h4>Hacking is not just for Computer Geeks</h4>
  <p>     
    Enterprising Oxford wrote a great blog post called <a href="http://www.eship.ox.ac.uk/hacking-not-just-computer-geeks">Hacking is not just for Computer Geeks</a> a few months ago.  The Digital Health Hacks adhere to a principle of being inclusive and supportive, and are open to everyone regardless of skillset.  As stated in the <i>"Hackathons bring people from various backgrounds together to work on and try and solve a problem.  It is really a big excuse to get together and work collaboratively on a problem."</i> There is also a lovely quote from Rohan Gunatillake, from Culture Hack Scotland:

    <blockquote>
    ‘Hack events are less of a factory and more of a gym, a playground and a nightclub. It’s a gym since it builds our prototyping and risk-taking muscles, a playground since it gives us a low-risk environment to try some things that are radically new and it’s a nightclub since it allows us to dance with a lot of different people we may not have otherwise met. And who knows, we may just meet the love of our lives.’        
    </blockquote>

We're looking for people who have ideas and skills and an interest in digital health, and if you're reading this, that probably describes you. All you need to do now is to come along to the Launchpad on the morning of Sat 7th May, armed with a laptop, energy and enthusiasm. People can pitch their ideas at the start of the day, then we'll arrange ourselves into teams to start working for the weekend.  Teams of around 4-5 people are generally the best size, and a mix of skills can be very valuable e.g. a team comprised of software skills, domain experience (e.g. clinician, researcher) and project management.  To help with team building, we'll be asking people to write down a couple of sentences about themselves on a postit note, for example:

<blockquote>Chris, DPhil student working in a biomedical research group. Have an idea for modelling WHO data on trans-national co-morbidities.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Stephanie, trainee GP. Have an idea for building a chronic disease monitoring app for patients using Apple's ResearchKit</blockquote>
<blockquote>Owen, software engineer, previously worked on a number of healthcare projects and have expertise in APIs and data modelling.</blockquote>

We have a Trello board to start off conversations on people and ideas online before the weekend, and will also move these to paper versions for Saturday morning. 

</p>

<p>
Food and drink will be provided during the day. Teams can finish on the Saturday at whatever time they like (although the Launchpad itself will close at 9pm), and we'll all reconvene at 9.30am on Sunday morning, where there will be breakfast available, then another few hours of hacking the final pieces of our projects together, and finishing on Sunday with presentations, demos and judging results from 3pm.  The weekend will finish by moving over to the Jam Factory at 4.30pm, and then leaving for home feeling great about a fantastic weekend of meeting new people, creating something awesome and seeing some new projects start.
