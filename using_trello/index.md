  Trello is a project management tool that organises cards into lists. Each card can be clicked to flip around and show a lot of detail, including labels, checklists, attached files, due dates, and assigned members.
</p>

<p>
  If you haven’t yet done it, take the Trello Tour https://trello.com/tour.  
</p>

<p>
  We have a few lists that we’d like you to look at and/or contribute to:  
  <ul>
    <li>
      People - add a card to this page with an introduction about yourself, what skills you’re bringing to the hack (technical or non-technical), what you’re interested in. etc. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Challenges - these challenges are set by clinicians and patient groups, in collaboration with the organising team.
    </li>
    <li>
      Projects This is a list for you to propose projects you’d like to work on, how you’d like to address one of the challenges, or start to put ideas down. If you like the project, you can click vote on that card.   
    </li>
  </ul>
    Hopefully you find this both easy and intuitive to use, and also a useful tool for organising ideas and projects for the hack weekend. Please let us know if you’ve any thoughts on how this works, or with any suggestions.
</p>

<p>
  You can also start voting for individual project ideas, which you think are good and/or interesting and you’d like to see happen, whether or not you’re involved in that team over the weekend. Click the ‘Vote’ button on the right-hand menu of a card that you like.
