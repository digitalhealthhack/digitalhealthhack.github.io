# Code of Conduct

The Digital Health Hack is a community conference intended for networking and collaboration in the Digital Health Oxford (DHOx) community.

We value the participation of each member of the DHOx community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the hackathon, whether officially sponsored by DHOx or not.

To make clear what is expected, all attendees, organizers and volunteers at any DHOx event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

**The Short Version**
DHOx is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for DHOx.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the event at the sole discretion of the DHOX organisers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

**The Longer Version**
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for DHOx.

If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.

**Contact Information**
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the DHOx organising group. You may also contact venue staff and ask to be put in touch with the event organiser â€” Richie Harrington.

If the matter is especially urgent, please call/contact any of these individuals:

**Richie Harrington: 07595 259876**

Event staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local police, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
