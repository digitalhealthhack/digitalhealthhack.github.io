#### 1 weekend :: 60 hackers :: 2 talks :: 9 mentors :: 8 projects :: 500 caffeinated beverages :: 3 sponsors

The second Digital Health Hack was held on the 15-16th November 2014, again hosted by fantastic The Oxford Launchpad and sponsored by the Oxford AHSN, Global Initiative, and Telenor.  Following on from a successful hack weekend in July, the aim was again to bring together people of different skill sets and expertise to work together on new digital health projects, to create new working relationships and interactions between the cross-disciplinary and cross-sector members of the Digital Health Oxford group, and to identify and come up with solutions to important problems in the themes of global health, mobile health, and other digital health solutions / projects.

A fantastic weekend was had by all, over 60 people attended over the weekend, and in addition to the five main teams, there was again a very encouraging and enthusiastic set of mentors who were available for questions, to provide advice, and help guide the teams:

- Isaac Holeman, Co-founder MedicMobile
- Amy O’Donnell, Head of ICT4Development, Oxfam
- Dr. Fred Hersch (clinical researcher, The George Institute, University of Oxford)
- Mark Stone (patient representative, member of MND Association national board)
- James Turnbull (co-founder Incuna)
- Gareth Nixon (co-founder Global Initiative)
- James Murray (curator, The Oxford Launchpad)
- Jim Moodie (founder, Oxford Startups)
- Patrick Beattie (co-founder of Diagnostics For All)

The weekend kicked off with short presentations from Isaac Holeman co-founder of MedicMobile and current PhD candidate at Cambridge University, and Amy O’Donnell, head of ICT4Development at Oxfam. Both gave fantastic talks on their successful mobile health projects in resource-poor settings, the challenges, ways in which they were overcome, and what the teams needed to keep in mind for the weekend.  Special thanks are due to both Isaac and Amy who were amazingly generous with their time in both giving the presentations and also helping mentor teams in their early stages before both having to fly out to different parts of Kenya later that day.

The projects included (some described by team members):

#### Red Button

>“Red button is a prototype wearable device for alerting your friends and carers that you need help, and where you are, without those friends needing an app or subscribing to a proprietary care network or service.  The hack was inspired by the problem experienced by a friend who suffers regular and sudden seizures, and needs to be able to quickly alert nearby carers on any given day.
The device is built using open hardware, connects to your phone via Bluetooth, and sends an SMS alert with a help message and a link to your location when you press the “red” button.  A working electronic device prototype and an accompanying smartphone app were created from scratch during the hackathon by the team of two – Cyan Collier, co-founder of Incuna – a healthcare digital agency, and general digital health software and hardware aficionado/ basher, and Carlos Pages,  a mobile App developer working in the digital health sector at Incuna.”


#### WHOAMI
> “The WHO Acute Malnutrition Indicator app is designed to aid clinicians in developing countries assess peadeatric malnutrition. Based on the paper tool developed by the WHO, the WHOAMI app aims to reduce inaccuracy and increase the speed of diagnosis while retaining a zero learning curve. The paradigm of simple UX and one-thumb control makes the app intuitive and easy to use. A data collection system and a series of automated, tailored sms messages promotes continued support and patient follow up.”

> (The WHOAMI team were awarded first prize for their efforts over the weekend by the judging panel, and subsequently presented at the pitch event at the Digital Catapult in December – Digital Health Pit Stop Week, gaining a notable mention from their judging panel for potential global impact.)


#### HTML5 strip-reader
> “At the last Hackathon, we created a proof-of-concept device for reading lateral flow diagnostic strips, using a Raspberry Pi, a camera and a bike lamp. The device was able to read a strip and give a quantifiable and consistent result as a percentage of a control.

> This time we continued our work to move the project on from being a proof-of-concept device, towards a cross-platform open source HTML5 toolkit for developing diagnostic strip reading apps any smartphone, tablet or laptop with a camera.

> During the weekend, the team developed strip-detection code to enable hand-held strips to be read by a variety of cameras and devices, and worked on converting the image processing algorithm to HTML5. The strip reading software was also successfully run on one of the prototype low-cost Firefox smartphones that were provided at the event.”

#### Ambulance Tracker
> “Inspired by motorcycle ambulances in Uganda, the Ambulance Tracker project is part of a larger goal of operating for-profit ambulance services in resource poor regions around the world. Using freely and cheaply available technology, the project aids in the monitoring and dispatch of ambulances, so that they can be quickly made available to those in need.

> Team members Johnathan, Jamie B, Rahul, Jamie R and Barry come from a diverse background. Johnathan Au is a full-time software developer who uses coffee to turn ideas into magic. Jamie Boutilier is an MBA student at the Said Business School. Rahul Jadhav is an entrepreneur who runs Ziffy, a startup based in Oxford. Jamie Rosen is an MBA student at the Said Business School. Barry Wong is a data scientist for LHASA Ltd, a drug toxicology software company based in Leeds“

#### Building a National Health IT System with Open Source Software
>“We set out to test a proof of concept national health IT system using Open Source Software. We set up several Amazon Cloud Server instances to host the software (representing a “Ministry of Health” and a “Hospital”) and installed two Open Source software programmes used to manage health information in resource-poor settings. DHIS2 (District Health Information Systems 2) is a web-based system to collating and reviewing healthcare indicators and is commonly used by developing countries to provide statistics on the state of healthcare in a country.  OpenMRS is an Open Source electronic medical records system that is used by clinics across Africa and other LMICs to help doctors and healthcare workers record information about their patients, prescribe drugs and communicate with other healthcare workers.

> Over the course of the weekend we succeeding in installing both systems on separate cloud instances and installed a sample database of 5,000 patients. We also attempted to connect the two software systems using a “plug-in” for OpenMRS that would enable us to upload data from OpenMRS to DHIS2. Although we were not able to get the plug-in working in the time available, we learned many valuable lessons about how these software programmes work and about the feasibility of using Open Source solutions to help build national health IT systems.”

#### Is It Good For Me
> “‘Is It Good For Me’ is a website that helps separate medical facts from medical myths. Despite our ever-increasing wealth of medical knowledge, medical myths about food, medicine, and supplements stubbornly persist. We’re passionate about taking an evidence-based approach to health decision-making, and through this site we want to share that perspective. We use data curated by the Cochrane Collaboration, a group of medical researchers and patient advocates who share our commitment to evidence-based medicine. This data is based on a number of rigorous randomized clinical trials. In each of these studies subjects are given a treatment or a placebo, and researchers use their observations to determine the effect the treatment has on the human body. In science, these kinds of studies are considered the gold standard. Our algorithm uses sentiment analysis developed by Stanford University to aggregate and interpret this vast array of medical research to give you an at-a-glance look at how things affect the human body — what’s good for you, and what isn’t.“

#### The Open Patient Portal Framework
> “Patient portals are an increasingly important part of what NHS Trusts offer to patients.  They facilitate smoother, more efficient, interactions between the patient, the Trust, and clinicians. In many cases digital innovations are becoming part of treatment pathways. Self-management systems allow patients themselves to become an expert in their own care. New devices can allow both patient and clinician to more effectively monitor the progress of an illness.”

> Led by Dr. Chris Hinds and comprising a team of experienced academic and industry professionals, aims for this weekend were to outline and initiate the ambitious project of establishing a framework for an open patient portal, and initial efforts to architect a solution. The concept and initial plans for the framework were presented, and very well received, at the end of the weekend.  Next steps are to form a core working group of interested stakeholders, and a community of contributors to enable the project to systematically follow up all the ideas that have been put forward so far and consult on their feasibility before documenting and releasing a more detailed proposal.

Thanks again to everyone who made it such a fantastic weekend, to the sponsors – the Oxford AHSN, Global Initiative, and Telenor for donating a number of Mozilla Firefox phones – to the Launchpad for being amazing hosts once again, and to all the mentors, speakers and participants.  The next hack weekend is due in March, and we can’t wait to see what happens with these projects in the meantime.
